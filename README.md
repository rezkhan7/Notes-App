# Objective

In the industry, you will not be working alone so it is imperative to be able to work on existing code bases. This ReactJS application is like a Github Markdown Editor and Apple Notes app hybrid. Most of the CSS for this project was already done, along with having dependencies installed through node.js. My tasks were to add functionality to the app such as saving notes across browser sessions, moving the most recently edited note to be at the top, adding note titles, and deleting notes. I ensured my code was properly synced with the existing code, and my code was as efficient as possible in terms of memory use.

### View when there are no notes are saved:



### Notes are saved across browser sessions / The first line becomes the note title :

### Most recently edited notes are shown at the top:

### Users can delete notes with ease
